## Known Bugs

Expanding and Shrinking the window while registering / logging in / logging out will sometimes cause the Buttons to break their positions.

Using the login and register button the first time the page is loaded can lead to a one time visual 'glitch' (both windows at the same time) if the user opens both at once.
